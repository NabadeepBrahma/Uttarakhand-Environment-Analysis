# Uttarakhand Environment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes environmental trends in Uttarakhand, focusing on key factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, forest cover, air pollution, and water quality. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and comparative assessments to understand past and present environmental conditions.

## Data Processing Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
   - Removed missing and inconsistent values
   - Standardized data formats for uniform analysis

2. Heatmaps and Correlation Analysis
   - Identified relationships between environmental factors
   - Highlighted key variables impacting the region

3. Time-Series Trends
   - Analyzed long-term variations in temperature, rainfall, and humidity
   - Smoothed data to identify trends and fluctuations

4. Comparative Analysis (Past vs. Present)
   - Compared environmental conditions between past and present periods
   - Evaluated changes in pollution, deforestation, and climate patterns

5. Final Report Generation
   - Summarized insights from the analysis
   - Created a structured report in PDF format

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab

## Outcomes
- Observed increasing temperature trends and changing rainfall patterns
- Identified declining forest cover and rising pollution levels
- Provided insights for potential environmental policies
